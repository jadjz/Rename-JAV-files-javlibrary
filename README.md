# Rename JAV Files
Rename JAV files downloaded from JAVLibrary.com to their common ID format. If you manually sort your library, and hate having your video file naming scheme cluttered and inconsistent, this is for you.

## About
**Rename-JAV.ps1** will:

* Rename JAV files to their ID format from files directly downloaded and torrented from JAVLibrary.com
* Move all files to a specified directory if desired
* Remove compressed '-5' format videos if the original exists

*The script does not perform any webscraping or metadata checks.* This is simply renaming through Regex checks, so make sure to confirm that all the files are being renamed correctly before confirming. If files are not being found, make necessary adjustments to the Get-Files function.

**Move-JAV.ps1** will:

* Move all found video files from a specified path to another specified path
* Delete all remaining files

This is useful if you commonly download torrents which contain a lot of extra trash files.

## How to use?
Clone the repository to a desired location. Run Rename-Jav.ps1 or Move-JAV.ps1 from a **non-administrator** PowerShell prompt. You may not be able to find network drives when running PowerShell as administrator. I recommend creating specified directories for downloading/sorting and then converting the script to an .exe with a [PS2EXE Converter](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5).

```
Rename-JAV -FilePath 'C:\Downloads\' -LogPath 'C:\Downloads\RenameLog.txt' -FileSize 500 -Recurse
```
**Example 2** Rename only files located in path C:\Downloads\ with filesize greater than 400MB and move all found video files to C:\Downloads\SortedFiles\.
```
Rename-JAV -FilePath 'C:\Downloads\' -DestinationPath 'C:\Downloads\SortedFiles\ -FileSize 400
```

**Example 3** Rename all files recursively in path C:\Downloads\ with filesize greater than 0MB without prompting yes/no. write log to C:\Downloads\RenameLog.txt.

The R/M column indicates if the file will be Renamed/Moved respectively.

## Known issues
I recommend not to use this script recursively within a very large directory. I would say up to 50 files at a time, but if all looks good, go for more. If you have downloaded files from alternative sources, you may run into issues where it breaks the script. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel the running script. Remove all conflicting files before running again.
